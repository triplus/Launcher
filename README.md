Launcher will facilitate a potentially faster workflow in FreeCAD by making a dedicated dialog box for users to type/search commands. 

### Usage
Start typing in Launcher search box to find commands or press Down Key to show all available commands.

### Installation
There are several ways one can install Launcher:
- as an Addon through the [FreeCAD Addon Manager](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons)
- as a FreeCAD module which will be available to use after FreeCAD is started. Install path for FreeCAD modules depends on the operating system used (see below)
- as a FreeCAD macro. '''Important note:''' when Launcher is used as macro InitGui.py file can be used directly or for convenience it can be renamed to Launcher.FCMacro.

#### Examples

##### Linux

`/home/user/.FreeCAD/Mod/Launcher/InitGui.py`

##### macOS

`/Users/user_name/Library/Preferences/FreeCAD/Mod/Launcher/InitGui.py`

##### Windows

`C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\FreeCAD\Mod\Launcher\InitGui.py`
